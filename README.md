8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item


1. Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves understanding the requirements of the user and translating them into a software solution. One effective way to do this is by creating "user stories,"  descriptions of the user's goals and expectations. These stories help the development team to focus on the user's needs and prioritize the developed features.

2. When approaching program development, it's important to consider the agile processes that  may include Scrum, or other agile methodologies. The goal of these processes is to ensure that the development team is flexible, collaborative, and able to adapt to changing requirements.

3. Being a good team member in software development involves communication, collaboration,  learn and adapt. It is important to actively listen to team members, contribute to the development process, and be open to feedback and criticism. Additionally, a good team member should have a positive attitude and be committed to achieving the team's goals.
